Slack is a micro-framework for web scraping using selenium.  Multi-threading is supported.  This is currently still in
development, however it's very possible to write and run your automations within the framework as it is..  Just know
that it's in development and that things will probably change as things progress.

## Install

Just download this as a .zip and then move the `Slack` directory into your `site-packages` folder.  Once there is a
stable release, there will be a pip install available.

## Dependencies

* [peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/)
`pip install peewee` + installing peewee's dependencies.
* [selenium python bindings](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/)
`pip install selenium`

Once you have the dependencies, you can download this repository and start using it as is, however you may want to read over the
documentation below.

## Examples

Check out [the documentation](https://github.com/Wykleph/Slack/wiki/Documentation) for the various parts and pieces in the wiki.
API documentation will be coming soon.
