selenext is a micro-framework for web automation/scraping using selenium in Python 2 or Python 3.  This is currently still in development, however it's possible to write and run your automations within the framework as it is.

## Install

Download this as a .zip or clone the git repository.  Go to the project directory and run:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Quickstart 

### Scaffolding

Scaffolding creates a new project folder and generates the project structure.

```python
from selenext import make_project
make_project('~/path_to_new_project_folder')
```


## Examples

Check out [the documentation](https://github.com/Wykleph/selenext/wiki/Documentation) for the various parts and pieces in the wiki. API documentation will be coming soon.
